# Photo Organizer

Python Script that can be ran to give some valuable insight into the pictures.   
Performs a bunch of utility functions for me regarding my photos.  
Developed because my photos are a mess, and i just wanted to clean them up.  
Other utilities were either too complex or did not perform the necessary functions.

# Features
* Uses Exif Data (Date Taken) to put photos in folders.
